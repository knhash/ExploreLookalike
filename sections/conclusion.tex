\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper we showcased our clustering-based lookalike approach for recommending content to Cold and Sparse users. We show empirical evidence that the approach works, based on a real-world A/B experiment over a period of 30 days. 

For future iterations, the system is being modified to incorporate new, richer features to better define the clusters. Experiments are also underway to test other clustering methods like Spectral Clustering, which should bring out the latent representation of the clusters better.
